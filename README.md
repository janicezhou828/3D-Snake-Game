I led a team of computer and mechanical engineers in the development of an arcade-style 3D Snake game. 

The gameplay is inspired by the classic Nokia Snake game.

We made a 3D version of this game by creating a 3D matrix of LED's. The game is controlled by a joystick and 2 buttons, for movement in the 6 directions.
